# updated website

Thanks to Ajinkya Jain, this repo and website style and design is from [Ajinkya Jain's github website](https://jainajinkya.github.io/). All credits for this repo and formatting structure goes to him. I am modifying the content to fit my profile. 
As mentioned in the [original repo](https://github.com/jainajinkya/jainajinkya.github.io) **Feel free to use template for your own purposes**, but please respect copyright for all the images/content in my `images`, `pdfs`, `_posts` folders. 

This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [this repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))
