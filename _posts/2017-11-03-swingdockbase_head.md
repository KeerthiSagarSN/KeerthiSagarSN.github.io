This work investigated the introduction of extended temporal graph and integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for the minimization of the 
makespan, with decision variables on the nodes and the edges, respectively for a swing and dock like robot for fixturing large sheet metals.
And also work comparing CSP formulation with Markov Decision process was investigated.
