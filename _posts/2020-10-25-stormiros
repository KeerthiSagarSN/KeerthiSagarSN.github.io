This work presents STORM, an educational and research oriented software framework for analysis and visualization of 
reciprocal screw systems for a class of robot manipulator and mechanisms, to help bridge the gap between theory and practice of application of screw theory in the constraint and motion analysis for
robot mechanisms.
